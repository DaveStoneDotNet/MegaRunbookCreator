A repository for learning Angular 2. 

Originally intended as a learning experience to prototype an internal line-of-business application 'hosted' in an ASP.NET MVC 'shell' using Windows Authentication . (Currently reconsidering that decision.)

Initially, these decisions were driven by a desire to fit in with our company's current ASP.NET Authentication, Web Api, and build processes. However, since this is essentially prototype code for learning Angular 2, I'm now more curious to see how easy it is to code, build, and commit code in VisualStudio 2015 and see if those VS2015 configurations can then be brought down into VisualStudio Code on my Mac - and just run.

Currently just returning arbitrary, hard-coded json.
